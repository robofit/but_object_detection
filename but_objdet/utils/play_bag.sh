# Description:
# Playback of bag files publishing the simulated time (corresponding to time in
# a given bag file) to the /clock topic.
#
# The playback is going in the loop. It is paused at the beginning (to run/pause
# press SPACE key).
#
# It is convenient to skip a few seconds at the beginning, since there are
# usually some data missing (e.g. there are no messages on cam3d/* topics
# used in COB) => START_TIME = something like 6.0
#
# How to run:
# . play_bag.sh -p PATH-TO-BAG-FILE [-t START-TIME]
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Default starting time
START_TIME=6
BAG_PATH=""

# Process script's arguments
OPT=-

            OPT=$i
        fi

    # Setting the parameter /use_sim_time to true indicates that time from /clock
